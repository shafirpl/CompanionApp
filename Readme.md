The app uses Bank of Canada's Valet Api to get real time USD to CAD rate, whcih is slightly lower than CIBC (the bank I use) rates. But I decided not to calibrate the data and use the rates received from valet api when converting the currencies as the conversion is meant to give an estimate.


The Android folder contains the android app, the iOS folder contains the iOS app, the dekstop folder contains the SysTop desktop app  and the backend folder contains the node.js app that is hosted on a digital ocean droplet. I usually use a Samsung Galaxy s20 Plus, Lg G5 and an iPhone XS Max on daily basis, so I decided to use the node.js app to sync the notes, ip addresses as well as car maintenance records among all of my devices.
